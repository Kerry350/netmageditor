# netmageditor

This is a very simple demo demonstrating the functionality discussed within a net magazine article. 

It is functional and you are more than welcome to fork it, learn from it and play with it. You could take this and start to build in some extra features, maybe the editors content could be saved to localStorage every 'X' amount of minutes?
